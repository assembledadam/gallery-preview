Hacky shell script that recursively grabs the first detected JPG image of each and every child directory it finds.

## Use

1. Place the shell scripts in the root directory containing the sub-directories you would like to scan.
2. Run ./script.sh
3. Once completed, view preview images in the newly created ./preview dir
